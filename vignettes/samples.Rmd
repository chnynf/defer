Here are samples of how the `defer` package is intended to be used:

## Interactive interface

Interactive use assumes that most of the symbols referred by the user
are defined in the global environment.

```{r}
pkg <- package(fun)
evaluate(pkg, 'opencpu://localhost:8000')
```


## Programming interface

Here the function is resolved within `run_remote` and not globally.

```{r}
run_remote <- function (fun, data) {
  srv <- 'opencpu://localhost:8080'
  pkg <- package_(fun)
  res <- evaluate(fun, data, srv)
  res
}
```
